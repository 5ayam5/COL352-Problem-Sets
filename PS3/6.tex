\begin{solution}{Question 6}\label{ques:6}
    \begin{question}
    Prove the following stronger version of pumping lemma for CFLs: 
If $A$ is a CFL, then there is a number $k$ where if $s$ is any string in $A$ of length at least $k$ then $s$ may be divided into five pieces $s = uvxyz$, satisfying the conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item for each $i\geq 0$, $uv^ixy^iz \in A$
    \item $v \neq \varepsilon$, and $y \neq \varepsilon$, and
    \item $|vxy| \leq k$.
\end{itemize}
    \end{question}

    \begin{proof}[Solution]
    %-------------------------idea-------------------------------------------
    Found the trick to finish the proof. We just need to increasing the size of the pump. Let $v$ be the number of variables in a Chompsky normal form grammar. If $2^v$ is the ordinary pumping length. Consider a new length $2^{3v}$. In the parse tree of a long string (of minimal length) of length greater than $2^{3v}$, there must be a path of height 3v. Thus some variable must occur 3 times. Then use the minimality of the parse tree to conclude that the stepwise retiteration can be pumped.
