\begin{solution}{Question 6}\label{ques:6}
    \begin{question}
        Let $M = (Q, \Sigma, q_0, \delta, F)$ be a DFA and let $h$ be a state of $M$ called its ``home‚Äù. A synchronizing sequence for $M$ and $h$ is a string $s \in \Sigma^*$ where $\hat{\delta}(q, s) = h$ for
		every $q \in Q$. Say that $M$ is synchronizable if it has a synchronizing sequence for some state $h$. Prove that if $M$ is a $k$-state synchronizable DFA, then it has a synchronizing sequence of length at most $k^3$. Can you improve upon this bound?

    \begin{proof}[Solution]
        Given a DFA $M$ such that $M$ is a k-state synchronizable DFA i.e there exist a sequence $s$ and state $h \in Q$ such that $\hat{\delta}(q, s) = h\ \forall q \in Q$.
        \\
        Let's define a set
        \[Q(v) = \{\hat{\delta}(q, v)\ |\ \forall\ q\ in\ Q\}\]
        We need to find a sequence $s$ to reduce the set states of size $|Q|$ to $\{h\}$ for some $h \in Q$. 
        \\
        \\
        Hence we will find word $w$ such that $|Q(w)| < |Q|$ and for any $s$ of length $ < |w|$ $|Q(s)| = |Q|$. In worst case 1 pair at a time synchronised then length of such a string can be at most $k(k-1)$ (maximum different pairs of state in a transition). Any string having length greater than $k(k-1)$ will have pair of states repeated and can be removed to find other string which will synchronize the pair of state, and hence the second condition will not hold true.
        \\
        \\
        Starting from $Q$, there can be at most $k-1$ such reductions. Thus length of sequence can be at most $k(k-1)*(k-1)$ i.e at most $k^3$.
    \end{proof}
