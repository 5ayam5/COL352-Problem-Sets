\begin{solution}{Question 2}\label{ques:2}
    \begin{question}
    The $n$-th Fibonacci number is defined as $F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1,$ and for all $n\geq3,F_n = F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$.\\
    Consider the language over $\Sigma = \{a\}$
    \begin{equation}
        L_2 = \{a^m | m = F_n\}
    \end{equation}
    Is $L_2$ regular? Justify your answer.
    \end{question}

    \begin{proof}[Solution]
        Let's consider an equivalence relation $\equiv$ on $\{a\}^*$ and suppose it is right congruence and refines given language $L_2$. Suppose that it has finite index i.e it has finite equivalence classes. 
        \\
        \\
        So, there exist $n$ and $m$ such that $1 \leq n < m$  and $[a^n] = [a^m]$ as the language is infinite.
        As the relation is right congruence then 
        \[[a^n][a^{fib_m - n}] = [a^m][a^{fib_m - n}]\] where $fib_m$ is the $m^{th}$ Fibonacci number.\\
        So, 
        \[[a^{fib_m}] = [a^{fib_m +( m - n)}]\]
        We know that $LHS \in L_2$ and, as $fib_m + (m-n) < fib_m + m < fib_m + fib_m < fib_m + fib_{m+1}$ we can say that $RHS \notin L_2$.
        
        This contradicts our assumption. Hence there doesn't exist a Myhill Nerode Relation for language $L_2$. So $L_2$ is not regular.
        
        
    \end{proof}
