\begin{solution}{Question 1}\label{ques:1}
    \begin{question}
    Prove that $L_1 = \{bin(p) : p$ is a prime number\} is not a regular language.
    \end{question}
    \tcblower{}
    \begin{proof}[Solution]
    Proof by contradiction using Pumping lemma.
    We use the contrapositive of the pumping lemma i.e.-
    %add equation
    
    to prove that $L_1$ is not a regular language.
    
    Let word $w\in L_1$ be a binary representation of a prime number p which can be represented as $xyz$ such that $|xy|\leq n$

    $$p=z + 2^my + 2^{k+m}x$$
    %yoooo
    % heyyy
    $$z + 2^my(2^{ki-k}-1) + 2^{ki+m}x$$ % take i = p and using Fermat's theorem, we'll get a multiple of p hence it is composite yoo

    $$a_1a_2\ldots a_{k-1} (a_k\ldots a_l)^i a_{l+1}\ldots a_n$$
    $$a_k\leq a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_{k+n-l} \leq a_n$$
