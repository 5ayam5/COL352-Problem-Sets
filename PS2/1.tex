    \begin{proof}[Solution]
    Proof by contradiction using Pumping lemma.\\
    We use the following corollary (contrapositive) of the pumping lemma-
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        &(\forall n \ \exists w \in L \text{ where }|w| \geq n, \forall w = xyz \text{ such that } y\neq \epsilon \text{ and }|xy| \leq n \implies \exists k \geq 0 \text{ s.t. }xy^kz \not\in L)\\
        &\implies L\text{ is not regular}
      \end{split}
    \end{equation}
    Let word $w\in L_1$ be a binary representation of a prime number p which can be represented as $xyz$ such that $|xy|\leq n\  \forall n$.
    
    Given the binary representation $xyz$, the value of prime p in decimal is:
    $$p=2^{k+m}x + 2^my + z$$
    After pumping y, k times, value of p changes to p'-
    $$p' = 2^{ki+m}x + 2^my\frac{2^{ki}-1}{2^k-1} + z$$ %pumping
    Where $\frac{2^{ki}-1}{2^k-1}$ comes from summing the geometric progression made by terms containing y\\
    Let i = p in this case-
    $$p' = 2^{kp+m}x + 2^my\frac{2^{kp}-1}{2^k-1} + z$$ %i = p
    By Fermat's little theorem, we know that if $p$ is prime then $a^p \equiv a$(mod p).\\
    Taking modulo p-
    $$p' = 2^{k+m}x + 2^my\frac{2^k-1}{2^k-1} + z$$ % taking modulo p fermat said hi
    which is same as
    $$2^{k+m}x + 2^my + z$$
    
    Since bin(p') is longer than bin(p), it implies that p is a factor of p', hence p' is not a prime.
    Therefore we can say that $\exists k \text{ such that } xy^kz \not\in L_1$.\\
    Hence proved that $L_1$ is not a regular language.
    \end{proof}
