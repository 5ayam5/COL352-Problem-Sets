    Show that regular languages are closed under the repeat operation, where repeat operation
    on a language L is given by
    \[
        repeat(L) = \{l_1 l_1 l_2 l_2 ..... l_k l_k | l_1 l_2 l_3....l_k \in L\}
    \]
    \end{question}

    \begin{proof}[Solution]
        To show regular languages are closed under the $repeat$ operation we will construct an NFA which recognises $repeat(L)$ language.
        \\
        Let $D = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ be the DFA which recognizes language L.
        \\
        \\
        \textbf{Construction:} Using $D$ lets construct NFA $N = (Q', \Sigma', \delta', q_0', F')$ which recognize langauge $repeat(L)$.\\
        Consider two states $q_i$ and $q_j$ in D such that $q_i, q_j \in Q$ and $\delta(q_i, l) = q_j$ where $l \in \Sigma$. We introduce here a new state $q'$ in $N$ for every transition in $D$ such that 
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
                \delta'(q_i, l) = q' \\
                \delta'(q', l) = q_j \\
                \delta'(q', l') = \phi\ where\ l' \in \Sigma and\ l' \neq l
            \end{split}
        \end{equation}
        
        So $N$ could be defined as following
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $Q'$ is set of all states in $Q$ and the new states introduced as described above.
            \item $q_0' = q_0$
            \item $F' = F$
            \item $\delta'$ can be defined from $delta$. Replace every transition in $\delta$ with transitions defined in equation 1. 
        \end{enumerate}
        
        Now we need to prove that language accepted by $N$ is same as $repeat(L)$. We will prove it using the following claim.
        
        \begin{claim}
            Let $s = l_1l_2l_3,,,l_k$ be a string accepted by $N$ then NFA will be at state which belongs to $Q$ after accepting character $l_{2i}$ $\forall i$.
        \end{claim}
        \begin{proof}
            We will prove the following hypothesis using induction to prove the above claim as true
            \[P(i)\ =\ N\ will\ be\ at\ a\ state\ belonging\ to\ Q\ after\ accepting\ character\ l_{2i}\ \forall i\ in\ string s\]
            \textbf{Base case:} For $i = 0$, $N$ will be at start state which is $q_0$ and belongs to $Q$. Hence $P(0)$ holds true.
            \\
            \textbf{Induction Step:} Lets assume that $P(i)$ is true i.e $N$ is in state belonging to $Q$ after accepting $l_{2i}$. Let the state be $q$. Now on accepting the next character $l_{2i+1}$ it can make transition to only states which were introduced in $N$ from $D$ according to equation 1. Let the state be $q'$ which belong to $Q'/Q$. According to $\delta'$ next state which can be reached from $q'$ is a state which belongs to $Q$. So the next character accepted in string s which is $l_{2i+2}$  will be same as $l_{2i+1}$ and $N$ will make transition to state which belongs to $Q$.\\
            Thus $P(i+1)$ is also true.
            Hence using induction we proves the above claim.
        \end{proof}
        
        In the proof above, we also stated that $l_{2i-1} = l_{2i}$ $\forall i$ in a string s accepted by $N$.\\
        
        Using the above claims we can state that a string $s$ accepted by $N$ is of the form $l_1l_1l_2l_2...l_kl_k$ where $l_1, l_2,.... l_k \in \Sigma$. As repeat is a bijection from to $L$ to language defined by $repeat(L)$ thus on applying the inverse of $repeat$ operation  on $s$ we get $l_1l_2l_3..l_k$ which belongs to $L$. Hence langauge accepted by $N$ is same as $repeat(L)$.\\
        
        A $repeat(L)$ is accepted by an NFA, hence the language is regular and regular languages are closed under $repeat$ operation.
        
    \end{proof}
\end{solution}
