\begin{solution}{Question 2}\label{ques:2}
    \begin{question}
     An all-NFA $M$ is a 5-tuple $(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$ that accepts $x \in \Sigma^*$ if every possible state that $M$ could be in after reading input $x$ is a state from $F$. Note, in contrast, that an ordinary NFA accepts a string if some state among these possible states is an accept state.  Prove that all-NFAs recognize the class of regular languages.
    \end{question}

    \begin{proof}[Solution]
    To prove: All-NFAs recognize the class of regular languages.\\
    To prove this, we first show that for every regular language there is one NFA which accepts it and every NFA recognizes a regular language.
        \begin{claim}
        For every regular language, there exists an all-NFA which recognizes the regular language.
        \end{claim}
        \begin{proof}
            We have a regular language $L$ which implies there exists a DFA representing it. We have to prove it can be recognized by an all-NFA.\\
            \textbf{Proof by deduction: }
            A DFA has only one final state. Either the string is accepted or the string is rejected based on the single final state. The definition of all-NFAs is that it accepts a string only when the string is accepted by all the possible final states. Since DFA has only one final state it is a type of all-NFA with single final state. Therefore, there exists a DFA which is a subset of all-NFAs.\\
            A regular language is a language which is accepted by a deterministic finite automaton. Since every regular language has a DFA which accepts it, and DFA $\in $ set of all-NFAs; for every regular language there exists an all-NFA which recognizes it.
        \end{proof}
        \begin{claim}
        Every all-NFA recognizes some regular language.
        \end{claim}
        \begin{proof}
            We have to prove that any language $L$ recognized by all-NFA is a regular language. For a language to be regular, it is to be identified by some finite automaton. Therefore we need to show that an all-NFA can be translated into a DFA (Since every NFA can be converted into a DFA). To do this, we try to find a DFA equivalent to that all-NFA.\\
            \textbf{Proof by construction: }
            Let the all-NFA which recognizes language $L$ be $N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$. Also, let $D = (Q', \Sigma, \delta', q_0', F')$ be a DFA which recognizes $L$ and will imply that $L$ is regular.\\
            Such DFA can be constructed in the following way:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item The alphabet $\Sigma$ of both $D$ and $N$ are same to ensure same input strings.
                \item Since all-NFA requires the string to be accepted for all Final states, the total number of states $Q'$ for DFA will be equal to Power set of $Q$ since DFA will have to consider all possibilities as well.
                \item Since all-NFA might involve epsilon transitions, to have a DFA version, the transition table $\delta'$ for a state $S$ (set of corresponding states in $N$) will be: \\
                 \[ \delta'(S, character) =  \bigcup_{s \in S}  \epsilon-closure(\delta(s, character)) \] 
                 \item helpppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppmeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee F' is weird to write
            \end{enumerate}
            
        \end{proof}
        Both Claim 2.1 and Claim 2.2 imply that for every regular language, there exists an all-NFA which recognizes and all-NFAs only recognize regular languages. Hence all-NFAs recognize the class of regular languages. Hence proved.
        
        
    \end{proof}
\end{solution}
