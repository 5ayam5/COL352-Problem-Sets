\begin{solution}{Question 2}\label{ques:2}
    \begin{question}
     An all-NFA $M$ is a 5-tuple $(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$ that accepts $x \in \Sigma^*$ if every possible state that $M$ could be in after reading input $x$ is a state from $F$. Note, in contrast, that an ordinary NFA accepts a string if some state among these possible states is an accept state.  Prove that all-NFAs recognize the class of regular languages.
