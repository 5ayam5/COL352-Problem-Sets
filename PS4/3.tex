    \begin{question}
        Let $C$ be a language. Prove that C is Turing-recognizable iff a decidable language $D$ exists such that
        $$C = \{ x | \exists y (\langle x,y \rangle \in D) \}$$
    \end{question}

    \begin{proof}[Solution]
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    To prove the iff statement, we consider the following parts one by one:
    \begin{proof}[Direction 1:]
    Given a decidable language $D$, the Language $C = \{ x | \exists y (\langle x,y \rangle \in D) \}$ formed is Turing recognizable. 
    \\
    \textbf{Proof:}
    For a language to be Turing recognizable, if a string $x \in \Sigma^*$ the TM halts and accepts it and if $x \not\in \Sigma^*$, TM either rejects it or keeps running.\\
    In our case, Language $D$ is Turing decidable, which means given an input $\langle x,y \rangle$ it either accepts or rejects the string and halts for every input.\\
    Given any string $x$, $C$ accepts it if there exists a string $y$ such that $\langle x,y \rangle \in D$. Hence our Turing Machine for $C$ keeps searching for a string $y$ given an input $x$ so that $\langle x,y \rangle \in D$. Since $y$ is of finite length it can always be found in finite amount of time, if such $y$ is found, $x$ is an accepted string and the TM halts. If no such $y$ is found, TM keeps looking for it indefinitely.\\
    This implies that language $C$ is Turing recognizable
    \end{proof}
    
    \begin{proof}[Direction 2:]
    Given language $C$ such that $C = \{ x | \exists y (\langle x,y \rangle \in D) \}$ is Turing recognizable, prove that $D$ is Turing decidable.
    \\
    \textbf{Proof:}
    
    
    
    \end{proof}
    
    On combining both proven statements in Direction 1 and Direction 2, we can say that given language $C = \{ x | \exists y (\langle x,y \rangle \in D) \}$ is Turing recognizable if language $D$ is Turing Decidable.
