\begin{solution}{Question 2}\label{ques:2}
    \begin{question}
        Show that single-tape TMs that cannot write on the portion of the tape containing the input string recognize only regular languages.
    \end{question}

    \begin{proof}
        Define the following function $f_w$ for such a Turing machine $M$ and input $w$:
        \begin{equation}
          \begin{split}
            f_w(q) &= q',\text{ when }M\text{ enters the input portion on }q\text{ and exits the input portion on }q'\\
            f_w(q) &= q_{accept},\text{if }M\text{enters input portion on }q\text{, never exits and accepts }w\\
            f_w(q) &= q_{reject},\text{if }M\text{enters input portion on }q\text{, never exits and rejects }w
          \end{split}
        \end{equation}
        It is easy to see that acceptance is decidable if $M$ doesn't exit the input portion. This is because there are only a finite number of states $|Q|$ and a finite number of positions $|w|$. Therefore, if $w$ isn't accepted within $|Q|^{|w|}$ steps after entering the input portion, we can reject $w$.\par
        We consider the following equivalence relation:
        \begin{equation}
          [x] \equiv [y] \iff f_x = f_y
        \end{equation}
        It is easy to see that this equivalence relation has a finite number of equivalence classes since total number of functions are $|Q|^{|Q|+2}$. We will now show that this relation also satisfies the property of right congruence:
        \begin{equation}
          \begin{split}
            &[x] \equiv [y] \\
            \implies &\text{every time }M\text{ goes from position }|w|\text{ to }|w|+1,\text{ it is at the same state for both }x, y\\
            \implies &[xa] \equiv [ya]
          \end{split}
        \end{equation}
        Therefore, $f_w$ defines an equivalence, right congruent relation with finite classes. Therefore, by Myhil-Nehrode theorem, $M$ recongizes only regular languages.
    \end{proof}
\end{solution}
